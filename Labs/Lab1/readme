To construct the files for the unionfind, Lab1, you can use the following options
	make			-- creates TestappQF
	make TestappQF		-- creates TestappQF program
	make testappQU		-- creates TestappQF program
	make testappQUPCR	-- creates TestappQF program
	make clean		-- removes all .o files and the executable program

To run the executable, type "./executable" where "executable" is the name of the executable
file created during make.

You will be prompted to enter the name of the input data file. Four input data files have been
included. They are:
	in.50.50
	in.50.1000
	in.1000.1000
	in.1000.10000

After you enter the filename and press "enter", you will be asked for confirmation.
Type "y" if the filename is correct, 
or "n" if you wish to change the filename.

At the conclusion of the program, the data will be displayed followed by the time, in seconds,
that it took for the operations to be executed.

Note: This program does not seem to work with the redirection operator
	(ie. time TestappQF > out.50.50), possibly due to the requirement of specifying
	the input data file.
