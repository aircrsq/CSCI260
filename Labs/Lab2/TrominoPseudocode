Get size of screen

Get board dimensions from user.
	Must be a an exponent of two.

Get the location for the empty square.
    Note: location entered by user is base 1 but array is base 0

Solve the board
    Divide the side of the board in half
    If half of the side - 1 is zero, (base case)
        If (1,1) is the empty square
            TroOne
        else if (1,2) is the empty square
            TroTwo
        else if (2,1) is the empty square
            TroThree
        else (2,2) is the empty square
            TroFour

    Otherwise (not base case)
        If the blank square is in the top left quadrant
		TroOne with one square in each of the other three quadrants
		Recursively call Solve for each quadrant using the square from TroOne
			as the blank square
        else if the blank square is in the top rigth quadrant
		TroTwo with one square in each of the other three quadrants
		Recursively call Solve for each quadrant using the square from TroTwo
			as the blank square
        else if the blank square is in the bottom left quadrant
		TroThree with one square in each of the other three quadrants
		Recursively call Solve for each quadrant using the square from TroThree
			as the blank square
        else the blank square is in the bottom right quadrant
		TroFour with one square in each of the other three quadrants
		Recursively call Solve for each quadrant using the square from TroFour
			as the blank square
Print the board
    For each row
        For each column
            print character at row column
Base Cases
    If half of side - 1 is zero
	TroOne /* blank in top left */
		(1,1) empty
		(1,2) bottomfill
		(2,1) rightfill
		(2,2) fill
	TroTwo /* blank in top right */
		(1,1) bottomfill
		(1,2) empty
		(2,1) fill
		(2,2) leftfill
	TroThree /* blank in bottom left */
		(1,1) rightfill
		(1,2) fill
		(2,1) empty
		(2,2) topfill
	TroFour /* blank in bottom left */
		(1,1) fill
		(1,2) leftfill
		(2,1) topfill
		(2,2) empty
