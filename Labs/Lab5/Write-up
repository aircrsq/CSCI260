Rotate Left(current node, parent node)
Rotate Left works by reassigning the pointers to applicable nodes then returning the current node.
A pointer to each of current's parent, grandparent, and greatgrandparent are initialized to point to
the applicable nodes.
Then grandparent's left child pointer is assigned current
	current -> parent is assigned grandparent
	current -> left pointer is assigned current's parent
	current's parent -> parent is assigned current
	current's parent -> right = current -> right;
	greatgrandparent -> right = current;
	current -> parent = greatgrandparent;
	current -> right = grandparent;
	grandparent -> parent = current;
	grandparent -> left = currentparent -> left;

If current's great grandparent is not a sentinel then we need to check to ensure the orientation of
the greatgrandparent and grandparent.
	If grandparent is a left child of great grandparent
	then set greatgrandparents -> left to currents -> parent -> parent
	otherwise grandparent is a right child of great grandparent
	then set greatgrandparents -> right to currents -> parent -> parent
otherwise set the current node to the current's parent
return the parent node
     
Rotate Left(current node, parent node)
Rotate Left works similiar to rotate left, except in the opposite direction by reassigning the pointers 
to applicable nodes then returning the current node.
A pointer to each of current's parent, grandparent, and greatgrandparent are initialized to point to
the applicable nodes.
Then grandparent's right child pointer is assigned current
	current -> parent is assigned grandparent
	current -> right pointer is assigned current's parent
	current's parent -> parent is assigned current
	current's parent -> left = current -> left;
	greatgrandparent -> left = current;
	current -> parent = greatgrandparent;
	current -> left = grandparent;
	grandparent -> parent = current;
	grandparent -> right = currentparent -> right;

If current's great grandparent is not a sentinel then we need to check to ensure the orientation of
the greatgrandparent and grandparent.
	If grandparent is a left child of great grandparent
	then set greatgrandparents -> left to currents -> parent -> parent
	otherwise grandparent is a right child of great grandparent
	then set greatgrandparents -> right to currents -> parent -> parent
otherwise set the current node to the current's parent
return the parent node
