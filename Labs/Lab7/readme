To construct the files for the graph, Lab7, you can use the following options
	make			-- creates testapp program
	make clean		-- removes all .o files and the executable program

To run the executable, type "./testapp".

Your menu options will be
   "Enter F to read a graph from a file,"
   "   or A to add an edge,"
   "   or R to remove an edge,"
   "   or L to list the neighbours of a vertex,"
   "   or S to search the graph from a vertex,"
   "   or D to for debug data display,"
   "   or P to for Vertex display,"
   "   or H for help,"
   "   or Q to quit."

---------------------------------
Reading the graph from a file - F
   You can read the graph data into the program from a file. The file must be of the format
5		
0 1 2 99
1 0 3 99
2 0 3 4 99
3 1 2 4 99
4 2 4 99
99

The first line is the number of vertices
Each Vertex line ends in a number greater than the number of vertices
The file ends in a number greater than the number of vertices

---------------------------------
Add an Edge - A
   You will be prompted to enter the vertex you would like to add an edge to and then
   you will be prompted for the vertex at the end of the edge

---------------------------------
Remove an Edge - R
   You will be prompted to enter the vertex you would like to remove an edge from and then
   you will be prompted for the vertex at the end of the edge

---------------------------------
List the neighbors of a vertex - L
   Not developed in this version

---------------------------------
Search from a Vertex - S
   You will be prompted for a vertex number
   A Breadth First Search will be displayed

---------------------------------
Debug print - D
   Will display the graph similiar to the input format

---------------------------------
Print a vertex - P
   Will display a vertex and all it's edges

---------------------------------
Help - H
   Will display the menu of commands

---------------------------------
Quit - Q
   will quit the program
