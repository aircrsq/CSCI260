The make file generates the necessary object files and executable for testing the RBbst ADT
and is dependant on RBbst.h and RBbst.cpp

Invoking "make" or "make testapp" will create the ./testapp executable file

Invoking "make clean" removes the object files and the executable file

To execute the file, type ./testapp at the command prompt

I you want to avoid having to build the RBbst by hand, I recommend using "./testapp < input.txt
 from the command prompt. This will read the inputs from the input file and create the tree.

The input.txt file is a list of 23 inputs that have been randomly choosen (asking my kids
to pick numbers between 1 - 100) and inserted into the tree in the order given. At the end of the inserts,
the tree is printed in preorder. Following the print, there are four removals of nodes that were randomly 
choosen followed by another preorder print
 
If you wish to change the tree, you can change the input.txt file, as you wish.

 Make targets:
   make		-- creates testapp program
   make testapp	-- creates testapp program
   make clean	-- removes all .o files and the executable
