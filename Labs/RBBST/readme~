The make file generates the necessary object files and executable for testing the RBbst ADT
and is dependant on RBbst.h and RBbst.cpp

Invoking "make" or "make testapp" will create the ./testapp executable file

Invoking "make clean" removes the object files and the executable file

To execute the file, type ./testapp at the command prompt

I you want to avoid having to build the RBbst by hand, I recommend using "./testapp < input.txt
 from the command prompt. This will read the inputs from the input file and create the tree. 
If you wish to change the tree, you can change the input.txt file, as you wish.

 Make targets:
   make		-- creates testapp program
   make testapp	-- creates testapp program
   make clean	-- removes all .o files and the executable
